Vim Configuration for Cool People
=================================
#####(Seriously, though, this is just my vim config crap. Take what you want, but don't expect too much.)

The vimrc.d idea was stolen from [here](https://github.com/mengbo/splite.vim).
I use vim-plug, not vundle, but same idea.

The buffer manipulation stuff was inspired by
[this article](http://joshldavis.com/2014/04/05/vim-tab-madness-buffers-vs-tabs/).

Installation
------------

1. Clone this repo
2. Back up your current vim config
3. Double check that you've backed up your current config (seriously, step 4
   will clobber it)
4. run `make`
5. ???
6. Win?
